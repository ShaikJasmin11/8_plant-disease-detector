#  Plant Disease Detector (CNN)

> RISE Internship Project 8 â€“ Tamizhan Skills  
> Built with TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, and Streamlit

A deep learning-based web app that detects plant leaf diseases from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is the eighth and final project from the **Machine Learning & AI** track of the RISE Internship by Tamizhan Skills.

---

##  Project Objective

To build a plant disease detection model that:
  - Loads plant disease images organized into class folders
  - Applies image preprocessing and augmentation
  - Trains a **CNN classifier** on 16 plant disease classes
  - Provides an intuitive **Streamlit interface** for image upload and prediction

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras (CNN)**
- **NumPy / Matplotlib**
- **Pillow (image handling)**
- **Streamlit** (for frontend UI)

## Dataset

- Source: PlantVillage Dataset â€“ Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Structure: Folder-per-class format (e.g., Tomato___Early_blight, Pepper__bell___Bacterial_spot, etc.)
- Contains ~33,000+ images across 16 plant disease categories
- Augmented during training using ImageDataGenerator

---

## How to Run

- Step 1: Install Dependencies
  
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Step 2: Train the Model
  
```bash
  python main.py
```

- Step 3: Launch the Web App
  
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Performance

âœ… Trained on 33k+ images across 16 plant disease classes
âœ… Achieved >50% accuracy in 3 epochs (base CNN, no pretraining)
âœ… Uses real-time inference on uploaded leaf images
âœ… Supports deployment on CPU with lightweight image sizes (64Ã—64)

---

## Highlights

- Supports image-based classification of plant diseases
- Modular CNN built with Dropout and MaxPooling for generalization
- Custom training loop with early stopping & learning rate scheduling
- Streamlit interface for image upload and prediction
- Easily extensible to new plant diseases or camera integration
  
---

## Future Improvements

- Integrate pretrained MobileNetV2 for better accuracy & speed
- Add confidence scores and probability bar chart
- Display leaf image preview with prediction
- Export predictions to PDF/CSV for field reports
